# Sublime-Text-packages
All the packages that I use for developing in python (might make one for java-script) 

These packages are for sublime text 3 as of 18/04/17 this list will probably change over time

# Packages
* All Autocomplete - Extends the autocomplete word list to find matches across all open files
* Package Control - Needed to install packages
* Random Everything - Useful for generating random int, floats and strings
* SidebarEnhancements - Adds a bunch of features that should be in sublime text
* anaconda - My favourite python linter packed full of features
* SublimeREPL - A REPL without leaving sublime text, what more can you ask for??
