# Sublime-Text-packages
All the packages that I use for developing in python (might make one for java-script) 

These packages are for sublime text 3 as of 18/04/17 this list will probably change over time

# Packages
* All Autocomplete - extends the autocomplete word list to find matches across all open files
* Package Control - needed to install packages
* Random Everything - useful for generating random int, floats and strings
* SidebarEnhancements - adds a bunch of features that should be in sublime text
* SublimeLinter - needed for pylint to work
* SublimeLinter pylint - tried anaconda but pylint is the most detailed and easy to use linter i have tried it also requires to use pip to install the pylint module. Best feature - has a convenient shortcut that locally disables a pylint check by inserting a  #pylint: disable comment.
* SublimeREPL - A REPL without leaving sublime text, what more can you
